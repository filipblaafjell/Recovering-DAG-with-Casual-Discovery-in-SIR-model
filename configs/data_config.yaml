# Configuration for data generation

# Model settings
model:
  type: "nonlinear"  # "linear" or "nonlinear"
  n_variables: 15
  seed: 42

# Sample sizes
samples:
  observational: 0  # Set to 0 to exclude observational data
  interventional: 800  # Samples per intervention

# Noise settings
noise:
  std: 1.0  # Standard deviation of noise terms

# Intervention settings
interventions:
  per_variable: 1  # Number of different interventions per variable
  types:
    - "uniform"
